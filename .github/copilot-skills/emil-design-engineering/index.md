# Emil's Design Engineering Principles

A comprehensive guide for building polished, accessible web interfaces based on Emil Kowalski's design engineering practices.

## Quick Reference

| Category | When to Use |
| --- | --- |
| [Animations](animations.md) | Enter/exit transitions, easing, springs, performance |
| [UI Polish](ui-polish.md) | Typography, visual design, layout, colors |
| [Forms & Controls](forms-controls.md) | Inputs, buttons, form submission |
| [Touch & Accessibility](touch-accessibility.md) | Mobile, touch devices, keyboard nav, a11y |
| [Component Design](component-design.md) | Compound components, composition, props API |
| [Marketing](marketing.md) | Landing pages, blogs, docs sites |
| [Performance](performance.md) | Virtualization, preloading, optimization |

## Core Principles

### 1. No Layout Shift

Dynamic elements should cause no layout shift. Use hardcoded dimensions, `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for changing numbers, and avoid font weight changes on hover/selected states.

### 2. Touch-First, Hover-Enhanced

Design for touch first, then add hover enhancements. Disable hover effects on touch devices. Ensure 44px minimum tap targets. Never rely on hover for core functionality.

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

Tabbing should work consistently. Only allow tabbing through visible elements. Ensure keyboard navigation scrolls elements into view with `scrollIntoView()`.

### 4. Accessibility by Default

Every animation needs `prefers-reduced-motion` support. Every icon button needs an aria label. Every interactive element needs proper focus states.

### 5. Speed Over Delight

Product UI should be fast and purposeful. Skip animations for frequently-used interactions. Marketing pages can be more elaborate.

## Decision Flowcharts

### Should I Animate This?

```
Will users see this 100+ times daily?
├── Yes → Don't animate
└── No
    ├── Is this user-initiated?
    │   └── Yes → Animate with ease-out (150-250ms)
    └── Is this a page transition?
        └── Yes → Animate (300-400ms max)
```

### What Easing Should I Use?

```
Is the element entering or exiting?
├── Yes → ease-out
└── No
    ├── Is it moving on screen?
    │   └── Yes → ease-in-out
    └── Is it a hover/color change?
        ├── Yes → ease
        └── Default → ease-out
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `transition: all` | Specify exact properties |
| Hover effects on touch | Use `@media (hover: hover)` |
| Font weight change on hover | Use consistent weights |
| Animating `height`/`width` | Use `transform` and `opacity` only |
| No reduced motion support | Add `prefers-reduced-motion` query |
| z-index: 9999 | Use fixed scale or `isolation: isolate` |
| Custom page scrollbars | Only customize scrollbars in small elements |

## Review Checklist

When reviewing UI code, check:

- [ ] No layout shift on dynamic content
- [ ] Animations have reduced motion support
- [ ] Touch targets are 44px minimum
- [ ] Hover effects disabled on touch devices
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works properly
- [ ] Icon buttons have aria labels
- [ ] Forms submit with Enter/Cmd+Enter
- [ ] Inputs are 16px+ to prevent iOS zoom
- [ ] No `transition: all`
- [ ] z-index uses fixed scale
