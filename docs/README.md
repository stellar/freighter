# Lyra Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

First build `@stellar/lyra-api` (a dependency of this project) by cd'ing to `@stellar/lyra-api` and running `yarn build`.

Then, come back to this directory and run:

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
