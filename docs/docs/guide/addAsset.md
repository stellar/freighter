## Adding a new asset to your account

If you would like to add an asset to your account balances, you can do that by clicking "Manage Assets" on the account balances screen.
This will navigate you to a screen where you can see your current assets and an "Add Asset" button. You can click that to find and add another asset.

If you don't find your asset by name, you can also enter the asset details in manually by providing the issuer's public key or the asset contract's ID in the case of [SEP-41 tokens.](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tokens/stellar-asset-contract)

Once you've found and confirmed your asset, you can click "Add Asset" to add it to your account balances screen.
