## Making a payment

You can make a payment from your account in Freighter to another account by clicking on the "send" button from the homescreen or by clicking into any balance in your account, and clicking "send" on the balance detail screen.

To complete a payment, follow these steps -

- Enter a recipient address, or select a "recent address" if you have a history of payments.
- Choose your payment asset and amount. You can select any asset in your balances to make a payment. Please note that if your recipient does not have a trustline open to the asset, the transaction will be rejected. You can also enter in an amount to send to the recipient, with an optional "set max" option which will send them your entire balance of that asset (unless it is XLM, in which case you need to maintain a base reserve).
- Set your desired transaction fee, timeout, and memo. Freighter will provide you with an estimate for an appropriate fee but you can choose to change it. Some exchanges(like [Binance](https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360052205274-Memos-on-Binance-US)) require the use of memos in order to properly interact with keys that they control. You can set a memo at this step.
- Confirm the transaction details and observe any potential warnings about your transaction before submitting to the network.
