## Navigating to advanved settings

In order to enable experiemntal mode, you can do the following:

- Open Freighter, and click on "Settings"(the cog) on our bottom navigation bar.
- Click on "Security" menu item
- Click on "Advanced Settings", and read the disclaimer. If you want to proceed, then click "I understand, continue"

## Settings

**Use Futurenet**
This setting enables access to the Futurenet network and disables access to Pubnet.

**Enable Blind Signing on Ledger**
This can be used to sign arbitrary transaction hashes without having to decode them first. Ledger will not display the transaction details in the device display prior to signing so make sure you only interact with applications you know and trust.

**Connect to domain without SSL certificate**
Allow Freighter to connect to domains that do not have an SSL certificate on Mainnet. SSL certificates provide an encrypted network connection and also provide proof of ownership of the domain. Use caution when connecting to domains without an SSL certificate.
