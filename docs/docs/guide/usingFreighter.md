title: Using Freighter
---

We now have an extension installed on our machine and a library to interact with it. This library will provide you methods to send and receive data from a user's extension in your website or application.

### Importing

First import the whole library in a NodeJs application

```javascript
import freighterApi from "@stellar/freighter-api";
```

or import just the modules you require:

```javascript
import {
  isConnected,
  getPublicKey,
  signTransaction,
} from "@stellar/freighter-api";
```

Now let's dig into what functionality is available to you:

### isConnected

#### `isConnected() -> <boolean>`

This function is useful for determining if a user in your application has Freighter installed.

```javascript
import { isConnected } from "@stellar/freighter-api";

if (isConnected()) {
  alert("User has Freighter!");
}
```

### getPublicKey

#### `getPublicKey() -> <Promise<string>>`

If a user has never interacted with your app before, this function will prompt the user to provide your app privileges to receive the user's public key. If and when the user accepts, this function will resolve with an object containing the public key. Otherwise, it will provide an error.

If the user has authorized your application previously, it will be on the extension's "Allow list", meaning the extension can immediately provide the public key without any user action.

```javascript
import {
  isConnected,
  getPublicKey,
  signTransaction,
} from "@stellar/freighter-api";

if (isConnected()) {
  alert("User has Freighter!");
}

const retrievePublicKey = async () => {
  let publicKey = "";
  let error = "";

  try {
    publicKey = await getPublicKey();
  } catch (e) {
    error = e;
  }

  if (error) {
    return error;
  }

  return publicKey;
};

const result = retrievePublicKey();
```

### getNetwork

#### `getNetwork() -> <Promise<"PUBLIC" | "TESTNET">>`

This function is useful for determining what network the user has configured Freighter to use. Freighter will be configured to either `PUBLIC` or `TESTNET`.

```javascript
import {
  isConnected,
  getNetwork,
  signTransaction,
} from "@stellar/freighter-api";

if (isConnected()) {
  alert("User has Freighter!");
}

const retrieveNetwork = async () => {
  let network = "";
  let error = "";

  try {
    network = await getNetwork();
  } catch (e) {
    error = e;
  }

  if (error) {
    return error;
  }

  return network;
};

const result = retrieveNetwork();
```

### signTransaction

#### `signTransaction(xdr: string, network:? string) -> <Promise<string>>`

This function accepts a transaction XDR string as the first parameter, which it will decode, sign as the user, and then return the signed transaction to your application.

The user will need to provide their password if the extension does not currently have their private key. Once the user has provided their password, the extension will have access to the user private key for 5 minutes. The user must then review the transaction details and accept within those 5 minutes for the transaction to be signed.

_NOTE:_ Then user must provide a valid transaction XDR string for the extension to properly sign.

The second parameter is an optional string that you may pass to indicate what network youâ€™re intending this transaction to be signed on. The parameter must be either `PUBLIC` or `TESTNET`. If you choose not to pass a param, freighter-api will default to `PUBLIC`.

This is useful in the case that the user's Freighter is configured to the wrong network. Freighter will be able to throw a blocking error message communicating that you intended this transaction to be signed on a different network.

```javascript
import {
  isConnected,
  getPublicKey,
  signTransaction,
} from "@stellar/freighter-api";

if (isConnected()) {
  alert("User has Freighter!");
}

const retrievePublicKey = async () => {
  let publicKey = "";
  let error = "";

  try {
    publicKey = await getPublicKey();
  } catch (e) {
    error = e;
  }

  if (error) {
    return error;
  }

  return publicKey;
};

const retrievedPublicKey = retrievePublicKey();

const userSignTransaction = async (xdr: string, network: string) => {
  let signedTransaction = "";
  let error = "";

  try {
    signedTransaction = await signTransaction(xdr, network);
  } catch (e) {
    error = e;
  }

  if (error) {
    return error;
  }

  return signedTransaction;
};

const xdr = ""; // replace this with an xdr string of the transaction you want to sign
const userSignedTransaction = userSignTransaction(xdr, "TESTNET");
```

freighter-api will return a signed transaction xdr. Below is an example of how you might submit this signed transaction to Horizon using `stellar-sdk` (https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk):

```javascript
import StellarSdk from "stellar-sdk";

const userSignTransaction = async (xdr: string, network: string) => {
  let signedTransaction = "";
  let error = "";

  try {
    signedTransaction = await signTransaction(xdr, network);
  } catch (e) {
    error = e;
  }

  if (error) {
    return error;
  }

  return signedTransaction;
};

const xdr = ""; // replace this with an xdr string of the transaction you want to sign

const userSignedTransaction = userSignTransaction(xdr, "TESTNET");

const SERVER_URL = "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org";

const server = new StellarSdk.Server(SERVER_URL);

const transactionToSubmit = StellarSdk.TransactionBuilder.fromXDR(
  userSignedTransaction,
  SERVER_URL
);

const response = await server.submitTransaction(transactionToSubmit);
```
