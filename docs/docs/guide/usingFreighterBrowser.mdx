import { VersionedUrl } from "./basics/VersionedUrl";

We now have an extension installed on our machine and a library to interact with it. This library will provide you methods to send and receive data from a user's extension in your website or application.

### Importing

First import the library in the `<head>` tag of your page.

- Install the packaged library via script tag using cdnjs, swapping in the desired version number for `{version}`

_NOTE:_ You must use version `1.1.2` or above

For example, include the `script` in your `head` tag using the following code:

<VersionedUrl />

This will expose a global variable called `window.freighterApi` that will contain our library.

The call signatures will be exactly the same as the [node version](./usingFreighterWebApp), but you will call the methods directly from `window.freighterApi`:

For example:

```javascript
if (await window.freighterApi.isConnected()) {
  alert("User has Freighter!");
}
```
