To get started, you'll need both the Lyra extension and the API needed to integrate with it.

### Install the Lyra extension.

You'll want a local version of the extension to test with.

- Head over to the [Chrome extension store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en) and install Lyra into your browser.

### Install Lyra API

Now we need a way to communicate with the extension. To facilitate this, we create a Javascript library called Lyra-API that will let you send and receives messages from the extension.

- Install the module using npm: `npm install @stellar/lyra-api`

or

- Install the module using yarn: `yarn add @stellar/lyra-api`
